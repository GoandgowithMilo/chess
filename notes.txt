Constraints:
 - The screen will be a fixed size and the pieces will be a fixed size within that - thinking 960x960
 - The screen is moveable and can be minized but cannot be resized
 - The position of players is fixed (e.g. white will always be at the bottom, black at the top)

Notes:
 - Need to fix the math for generating the colours on the grid
