Constraints:
 - The screen will be a fixed size and the pieces will be a fixed size within that - thinking 960x960
 - The screen is moveable and can be minized but cannot be resized
 - The position of players is fixed (e.g. white will always be at the bottom, black at the top)

Notes:
 - A chess board is 8x8
 - If I make an 8x8 grid of rectangles I can use SDL_RectFills to fast fill all of a set the right colour
 - Possibly I can extend this to making an 8x8 set of my own objects which have the colour fill for the square +
 - some details about what piece is stored in them
